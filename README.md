Overall I enjoy this course a lot, it introduces a lot of basic and fundamental concepts regarding AI & ML and how to optimize them. They also go above and beyond to explain fundamental concepts in LLM and how we can get them to run on constraint edge environtments too. I really have a lot of fun working on the course content!
